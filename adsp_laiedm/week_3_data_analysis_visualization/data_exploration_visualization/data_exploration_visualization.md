Dimensionality Reduction:


The t-SNE algorithm calculates a similarity measure between pairs of instances in the high dimensional space and in the low dimensional space. This is done by setting the probabilities from the low-dimensional space similar to those of the high dimensional space. We measure the difference between the probability distributions of the two-dimensional spaces using Kullback-Leibler divergence and try to optimize it.

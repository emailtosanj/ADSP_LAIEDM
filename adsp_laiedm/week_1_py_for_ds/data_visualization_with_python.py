## Scatterplot

Sometimes we want to know if two variables mean something when put together, whether a small change in one variable affects the other variable. In such cases, plotting a **scatterplot**, or **scatter-diagram**, with our data points can help us to check whether there is a potential relationship between them.

- A **scatterplot** is the simplest mode of a diagrammatic representation of two variables.
- It takes two perpendicular axes of coordinates, one for x and one for y.
- Unlike the lineplot, it directly plots each pair of values as a point on the 2D space.
- The *scatterplot()* function of seaborn can be used to make a scatterplot.

Correlation means association. More precisely, it expresses the extent to which two variables change together at a constant rate.

- Again, when the y variable tends to decrease as the x variable increases, we say there is a **negative correlation** between the variables.
- If the points on the scatter plot seem to be scattered randomly, we say that there is **no correlation** between the variables.

**Let's check out the relationship between a few more variables using scatter plots.**

1. A strong correlation will have data points close together, while a weak correlation will have data points that are further apart.
2. We can not measure the relationship quantitatively using a scatter plot. It just gives an expression for the relative change between the variables.

We can see from the scatterplot of `engine_size` vs `horsepower` that there is a positive correlation between the two variables. Now, we want to measure the relationship between these two variables quantitatively and try to predict the '**horsepower**' based on '**engine size**'. This can be easily done by fitting a linear model. Here comes the seaborn ***lmplot()*** function to help us with that.

While we can view and analyze these plots separately, having them together in a single visualization would allow us to capture a lot more information in a concise manner.

## Joint plot

* A jointplot helps to quickly visualize the bivariate and univariate profiles on the same plot.
* It comprises three plots - one displays the relationship between two variables while the other two show the individual distribution of each variable in the margins.

In such cases, we can *divide the entire plot into bins using different shapes (square, triangle, hexagon, etc.)* and then try to see the number of data points falling within each of the bins.

seaborn's *jointplot()* provides a '**hex**' kind to plot the data in above-mentioned way.

## Customizing plots

- In this section we will see how we can customize  plots by using different matplotlib and seaborn functions.

To change the axis scales of a plot:

```
    plt.xlim(left, right)   # here left and right indicates the min and the max limits of  x-axis respectively
    plt.ylim(bottom, top)   # here bottom and top indicates the min and the max limits of  y-axis respectively
```

To change the plot title and axis labels:

```
    plt.title()
    plt.xlabel()   # for x_axis labels
    plt.ylabel()   # for y_axis labels
```

To show the grid lines of a plot:

```
    sns.set(style="darkgrid")
    sns.set(style="whitegrid")
    sns.set(style="white")
```

To hide the axes of a plot:

```
    plt.axis('off')   # it will hide both the x-axis and y-axis
```

To customize labels of the plot legend:

```
    ax.legend([])   # takes list of the legend values
```

To change the position of the plot legend:

```
    plt.legend(loc=___)
```

The following values can be added to *loc* to change the location of the legend:
- 'upper left', 'upper right', 'lower left', 'lower right', 'center', 'best', [etc.](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.legend.html)

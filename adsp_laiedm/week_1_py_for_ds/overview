WEEK 1 OVERVIEW
In this week's module, we will dive into two fundamental libraries extensively employed in
Data Manipulation: NumPy and Pandas. These libraries serve as fundamental building blocks for
data manipulation, analysis, and processing tasks. We will also explore various visualization
tools to enhance our data summary and visualization capabilities, with a focus on the widely
used Python libraries, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly.

NumPy arrays and Functions
#Why Numpy ? - numpy package/library addresses performance computational limitations which python lists could not.

#version of python
import sys
print('python version', sys.version)
#version of numpy
print('numpy version',np.__version__)

#python version 3.11.12 (main, Apr  9 2025, 08:55:54) [GCC 11.4.0]
#numpy version 2.0.2
Accessing and Modifying NumPy arrays
Saving and Loading NumPy arrays

#pandas -- 2.2.2
Pandas Series (Creating, Accessing, and Modifying Series)
Pandas DataFrames (Creating, Accessing, Modifying, and Combining DataFrames)
Pandas Functions
Saving and Loading datasets using Pandas

matplotlib version -- 3.10.0
seaborn version -- 0.13.2

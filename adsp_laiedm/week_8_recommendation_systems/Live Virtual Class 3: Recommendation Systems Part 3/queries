To learn more about this algorithm, please refer to this paper

The python library to use this algorithm is not currently present in PyPi.
The code repository is present in this GitHub repository:
https://github.com/AbdullahO/mSSA. So we will be using a different way to install
the library on your local machine.

Below we have provided the steps to follow to install this library.

Hi

This is regarding the python notebook "Matrix Factorization for Time Series Forecasting.ipynb" in
"Live Virtual Class 3: Recommendation Systems Part 3" -
the way execution of code to do.

From the perspective of use as a standard in the industry and visualize to work,
this approach seems not practical holistically.

I would like to check with the learning team to help and get alternative for this.
As in standard way of getting package which are in PyPI ready and safe to use.

Not sure if this is only package, currently, as a student would like to learn here
and get the right direction so to do the right thing moving forward.

Awaiting humbly to your response.
